VLSI (Very large scale integration) is a process of integrating hundreds or thousands of transistors onto a single silicon semiconductor microchip. In present years, contemporary VLSI technology Complex digital systems can now be realized on a single silicon chip. Designers of Custom systems find this technology, particularly attractive since it allows for significant cost reductions by compressing a large amount of digital logic complexity into a single chip.
